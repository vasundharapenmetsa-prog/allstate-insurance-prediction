### Undercutting ALLSTATE online Case

### Data Preparation ###########################
################################################
###
### Lets see a summary of it
###
summary(ALLcost)
### there are plenty of things to decide here.
### Which variables have NA's:
### risk_factor also has NA (that should be also a level)
### duration_previous it has 0 and NA's we probably need to treat them differently.
### C_previous
### location
### 
### Lets print the first 6 data points
ALLcost[1:6,]
### we see that the first customer requested 2 quotes
### if we are predicting the behavior of the customer, we should take that in consideration
### but first we will predict the cost quoted by ALLSTATE
### so we start by assuming it does not discriminate across used id and shopping_pt (an assumption)
drop <- c("customer_ID","shopping_pt","record_type","time","location")
### This creates a dataframe (DATA) from d without the columns in drops
DATA <- ALLcost[,!(names(ALLcost) %in% drop)]
###
DATA$car_value <-  factor(DATA$car_value)
DATA$day <-  factor(DATA$day)
DATA$state <-  factor(DATA$state)
duration_NA <-  ifelse( is.na(DATA$duration_previous) , 1, 0 )        ### creating a dummy variable for NA
### number of NA in duration
sum(duration_NA)
### corresponds to 5% of the sample 783/15483
sum(duration_NA)/length(duration_NA)
### It is not that big and we could just drop them in a first analysis
### however we wil create a dummy variable
DATA$duration_previous[duration_NA>0] <-0 ### making NA to zero
### lets look at C_previous
C_NA <-  ifelse( is.na(DATA$C_previous), 1, 0 )        ### creating a dummy variable for NA
### how many?
sum(C_NA)
### very suspecious...
cor(C_NA,duration_NA)
### HAHA... the same observations that do not report previous duration...
### Lets treat C_previous as factor
DATA$C_previous[C_NA>0] <-0 ### making NA to zero
DATA$C_previous <-  factor(DATA$C_previous)                           
### Lets look at risk_factor as well...
risk_NA <- ifelse( is.na(DATA$risk_factor), 1, 0 )
sum(risk_NA)
### The NA for those are different observations...
DATA$risk_factor[risk_NA>0] <-0                     
### treat thatas a level "0" (a new category of risk...)
DATA$risk_factor <-  factor(DATA$risk_factor)                           
###
DATA$homeowner <-  factor(DATA$homeowner)
DATA$married_couple <-  factor(DATA$married_couple)
summary(DATA)
### there should be no NA's in the data at this point....

#### Question 1: Visualization
#################################
#### A suggestion is to go back to Class 1 and Class 2 Scripts
#### No additional hints for visualization at this point
library(ggplot2)
x <- DATA$car_age
y <- DATA$car_value
z <- DATA$D
df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y, z = z)
# Creating Heat Maps with ggplot2
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = z)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of B vs. car_age and car_value", x = "car_age", y = "car_value") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red")  # Setting the color gradient

#################################
#### Question 2: A first linear Regression Model. 
####             Feel free to use this or improve upon it.
# Fit a linear regression model
# Basic linear regression model using all the variables in DATA
result <- glm(cost ~ ., data = DATA) 

# Summary of the regression model
summary(result)

# R-squared calculation
R2_value <- 1 - (result$dev/result$null)
print(paste("R-squared value is:", R2_value))







#### this is a linear regression with all the variables in DATA
result <- glm(cost ~ ., data = DATA) 
### and to see the results (coefficients, p-values, etc...)
summary(result)
### the R-squared in this case is 
1 - (result$dev/result$null)

### As a side note, note that when running regressions, 
### sometimes R creates new columns automatically to run the regression
### for example, it creates dummies for you if you have columns that are
### factors. To get matrix with all these columns explicitly created 
### for the following regression
result <- glm(cost ~ ., data = DATA)
### simply use the command "model.matrix" as follows
M <- model.matrix(cost~., data = DATA)
summary(M)
### thus the same regression can be run as
resultM <- glm(DATA$cost ~ M)
### Just to make sure, lets see that R2 match...
1 - (resultM$dev/resultM$null)
###
### By having the design matrix you can easily drop or add variables
### based on any rule you like to use.
### For example, if you want to use only the first 5 columns of M
### you simple call with M[,1:5]
resultM5 <- glm(DATA$cost ~ M[,1:5])

#### Another model one can consider is the one that 
#### would include interactions based 
#### on the the coverage options A through G
#### we can add those interactions in addition to the previous variables
result_interactions <- glm(cost ~ .+(A+B+C+D+E+F+G)^2, data = DATA) 
#### this has all the variables plus all the interations 
####
####

#### Questions 3 is conceptual questions about modeling framework.

### Question 4 Provide quotes for new.customers
#################################

## The following command loads the "new.customers" to memory
## it is already formatted in our conventions 
## (where NA's in some variables were turned to level "0")
new.customers <- readRDS("NewCustomers.Rda")
##
predict (result, newdata = new.customers)

mod1 <- glm(cost ~ .-day-state-D, data = DATA)
summary(mod1)

mod2 <- glm(cost ~ .-day-state-D-group_size-risk_factor-B, data = DATA)
summary(mod2)

predict (mod2, newdata =new.customers)
